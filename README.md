Simple BX compatible RPG System

Simple BX is a less of a complete RPG system, but more of a list of references to other documents in order to put together a more modern BX.  Maybe someday I'll get permission from all the sources to compile this into a single PDF (or *gasp* a POD book), but for now it will just be links and a little text as glue.

I don't really want to reinvent the wheel.  So the first and biggest references that I'll use are from Gavin Norman's systems and SRDs.  I'll just Include links here:
