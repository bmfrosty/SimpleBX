# SimpleBX
Simple BX compatible RPG System

Simple BX is a less of a complete RPG system, but more of a list of references to other documents in order to put together a more modern BX.  Maybe someday I'll get permission from all the sources to compile this into a single PDF (or *gasp* a POD book), but for now it will just be links and a little text as glue.

Damage on a successful weapon attack is no longer depedent on the weapon, but on the class instead.  It's the same as the Hit Die used for hit points.  It still has to be an appropriate weapon.  For instance, a Wizard can't use a 2-Handed sword.

I don't really want to reinvent the wheel.  So the first and biggest references that I'll use are from Gavin Norman's systems and SRDs.  I'll include a bunch of links:

# First rules

* The Referee/Judge/GM/DM is always right, and if he, she, or they say that character creation works differently, then in their game character creation works differently.  Same with everything else.
* Something else

# [Character Creation]()

Roll 3d6 DTL.  The line is whatever the DM says it is.  Usually Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, and Cha.

Calculate the [Ability Modifiers](https://www.dolmenwood.necroticgnome.com/rules/doku.php?id=ability_scores#ability_modifiers1) and add up the modifiers.  If they're +1 or better combined, you passed teh first test for a valid character.  Then each class has requirements of a +1 or better in it's prime requisites.  A party should normally be constitued (from most common to least common) of Fighters, Dwarves, Clerics, Halflings, Magic Users, and Elves.
