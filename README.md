# Dio OSR RPG System

This is a less of a complete RPG system, but more of a list of references to Dolmenwood and OSE in order to put together a more modern BX.  I'm copying and pasting parts of the rule system available in the [online reference](https://www.dolmenwood.necroticgnome.com/rules/doku.php?id=start) to make this more legible.  If Gavin Norman/Necrotic Gnome/Exalted Funeral reaches out to me and asks me to take down or rewrite it, I will.  If you use or enjoy this document, please consider purchasing OSE and Dolmenwood from Necrotic Gnome, written by Gavin Norman, distributed by Exalted Funeral.

This document is intended for referees and players that have at least some experience with OSR systems.

Race and Class are separate in this document.  The intent is that they act enough like B/X to not make much of a difference.
The ELF fighter/mage is excluded for now.

# First rules
* The Referee is always right, and if they say that character creation works differently, then in their game character creation works differently.  Same with everything else.
* Something else

# [Character Creation]()
* Use a Tool to roll [Ability Scores](https://www.dolmenwood.necroticgnome.com/rules/doku.php?id=ability_scores#ability_modifiers1).  
* [I've created a tool for this](https://bmfrosty.github.io/SimpleBX/).  Either run it with defaults (3d6 down the line) and create a character based on the rules on page 14 of the Classic Fantasy rules tome, or ask your Referee about alternate character creation.  My suggestion would be to set requirements, prime requisites, and constitution to 9 and then take whatever it gives you first.  You're referee may allow you to set them higher.

# Starting Level

* Characters typically start at level 1
* Sometimes an adventure starts at a higher level or a referee will allow replacement characters to be generated at a higher level.
* When this happens the Referee should probably not start all character types at that level, but instead should give them starting experience points equal to a Fighter at that level.

# Rolling hit dice

It is possible for hit dice to roll poorly to initially or eventually make a character barely viable or non-viable. This author therefore suggests the following:

* At level 1 allow the player to reroll 1s on hit dice.
* At level advancement, reroll all hit dice.
    * HP always goes up.
        * Constitution is counted separately in this.

Examples of rerolling all hit dice where new total is lower:

Barnaby is a level 1 fighter with a 13 in Constitution for a Constitution bonus of 1.  At level 1 he rolled a 5 and ended up with 6 HP because of his constitution bonus.  At level 2 he rolled both hit dice and got a total of 4.  In this case he would end up with 8 HP.  The 4 from the dice would be adjusted to 6 plus the 2 HP from constitution bonuses.

# Level Advancement

Level advancement mostly consists of updating your character sheet with the following:

* New Saving Throws
* New to-hit bonuses
* New changes to Skill Targets
* Updated HP Maximums

# Races

## [Human](https://www.dolmenwood.necroticgnome.com/rules/doku.php?id=human)

Humans have the following traits:
* Deciciveness
    * When an Initiative Roll is tied, humans act first, as if they had won initiative.
* Leadership
    * The Loyalty rating of retainers in the employ of a human character is increased by 1.
* Spirited
    * Humans are quick to learn and adapt and gain a +10% bonus to all Experience Points earned. This is in addition to any XP bonus due to the character’s Prime Requisite. For example, a human with a Prime Requisite of 15 gains a total 15% XP bonus—5% for the Prime Requisite and 10% for their Race.

## [Dwarf]()

Dwarves have the following traits:
* Requirements: CON 9
* Ability Modifiers: -1 CHA, +1 CON
* Available Classes and Max Level:
    * Cleric*: 8th
    * Fighter: 10th
    * Thief*: 9th
    * *These are available at the Referee's Option
* Combat
    * Dwarves can only use small or normal sized weapons.  They cannot use longbows or two handed swords.
* Detect Construction Tricks
    * Dwarves have a *ST* of 5 in a *Skill Check* to be able to detect new construction, sliding walls, or sloping passages when searching.
* Detect Room Traps
    * Dwarves have a *ST* of 5 in a *Skill Check* to be able to detect room traps when searching.
* Infravision
    * Dwarves have Infravision to 60'
* Listening
    * Dwarves have a *ST* of 5 in a Listen *Skill Check* 
* Resilience
    * Dwarves get a bonus to saving throws for Death/Poison, Spells, and Wands/Staves based on their CON scores:
        * 6 or lower: no bonus
        * 7-10: +2
        * 11-14: +3
        * 15-17: +4
        * 18: +5

## [Halfling]()

## [Elf]()

# Classes

## [Cleric](https://www.dolmenwood.necroticgnome.com/rules/doku.php?id=cleric)
Prime Requisite: Wisdom
Hit Die: d6
Armor: Any Armor or Shield that isn't infused with Arcane Magic.  Most magic armor isn't infused with Arcane Magic.  Ask your Referee.
Weapons: Any Weapon that isn't infused with Arcane Magic.  Most magic weapons isn't infused with Arcane Magic.  Ask your Referee.

Clerics use Holy Magic.

## [Fighter](https://www.dolmenwood.necroticgnome.com/rules/doku.php?id=fighter)
Prime Requisite: Strength
Hit Die: d8
Armor: Any Armor or Shield
Weapons: Any Weapons

* Fighters can use suitable weapons 2 handed.
    * This prevents the use of a shield, but adds +1 damage to the damage die result.  +2 on a critical hit.

## [Thief](https://www.dolmenwood.necroticgnome.com/rules/doku.php?id=thief)

## [Magic User]()

# [Equipment](https://www.dolmenwood.necroticgnome.com/rules/doku.php?id=adventuring_gear)

| Name | Cost (gp) | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Bandages | 1 | A pack of 10 Bandages |
| Smelling Salts | 10 | A glass vial of smelling salts |

## [Weapons and Armor](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Weapons_And_Armour)

Base AC is 10.  If you have no armor, your AC will probably be 10.

For players, you may want to check with your DM about prices - many prepackaged campaigns and other B/X derivitaves have different pricing.

# [Core Rules](https://www.dolmenwood.necroticgnome.com/rules/doku.php?id=core_rules)

The biggest change between OSE and Dolmenwood is the Core Rules.  It replaces 5 different player facing resolution mechanisms with 2.

They are:

## Saves

These have been renamed but otherwise work the same.

| Dolmenwood Name | B/X or OSE Name |
| - | - |
| Doom | Death |
| Ray | Wands |
| Hold | Paralysis/Petrify |
| Blast | Breath Attacks |
| Spells | Spells / rods / staves |

## Attack

Attacks are still roll high, but it's simple ascending AC than the hodge podge of matricies, THAC0, and different mix of Base AC and mechanics used in various TSR products and various retro clones.

## Skills

These have moved from a mix of percentile and x-in-6 (which are both roll low) to a d6 roll with a *Skill Target* or *ST*.  Some are modified by Ability Modifier and some are not.  See Thief and the core rules document for more detail.

## Ability Check

Ability checks are a d6 roll, modified by ability modifier, with a target of 4.

## [Inventory]

Use a slot based inventory

[There's an interesting one that Gavin Norman](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0017/2330/1933/files/Item-Based_Encumbrance_-_Play_Test_v0-2.pdf) put in Carcass Crawler eventually.  I think I like this one the best of what I've seen.
[Here's a character sheet for it](https://necroticgnome.com/products/old-school-essentials-purist-character-sheet)

## Combat

Dolmenwood combat hasn't made it's rules reference yet.

It's summarized thusly:

1. Declare Intention to cast spells or to retreat from melee.  See Below.
2. Initiative (Each side rolls a d6.  Higher roll wins.)
3. Winning Side Acts
3a. Movement
3b. Missile Attacks
3c. Magic
3d. Melee Attacks
4. Losing Side Acts (repeat steps 3a-3d)
5. Morale (Referee makes a morale check)

Combatants are considered in Melee if they're within 5' of each other and one or both has made a melee against the other.

If the losing side has spells being cast, the spellcasters can be interrupted and have their spell fail of an attack is successfully made against them.

If the losing side has characters in melee attempting to flee, then attacks against those characters are made at a +2 bonus to hit.

[OSE Combat](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Combat)
[Labyrinth Lord Version on Page 52](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/64331/labyrinth-lord-revised-edition-no-art-version)

Bunch of ways to do combat rounds.  

### [Surprise]()

This is mostly play it by ear.  If the players get it, they get a free round where don't get a turn and visa versa.

### [Initiative]()

Players should take turns doing a d6 roll-off with the referee.  If the player is controlling a human PC, they win ties verses the referee.

### [Player Combat]()

# [Magic]

## [Arcane Magic]()

### [Level 1 spells:](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Magic-User_Spells)

1. Charm Person
2. Floating Disc
3. Hold Portal
4. Light (Darkness)
5. Magic Missile
6. Protection from Evil
7. Read Languages
8. Shield
9. Sleep
10. Ventriloquism

See the Link in the header for a list of all spells.  We drop two in SimpleBX because Arcane Casters (Magic Users) deal with Read Magic and Detect Magic as Ability and Skill Checks.

Read Magic:

Roll a d6 modified by intelligence with a *ST* of 4.

Detect Magic:

Roll a d6 with a DC that becomes easier with level.

#### Learning Spells

Learning a new spell is done in one of two ways. Transcription or Research.

### Transcription

You must posess a Scroll or Spellbook of the spell in question.

Roll an Int ability check.  If you succeed, you've transcribed the spell to your spellbook.  If you fail and it's from a scroll, the scroll crumbles and is now gone.  If it's a spellbook, you get to try again when you go up a level.  You can try again at the same level with a different source spellbook or scroll.  This takes an adventuring day and has a cost of 0 gold.  You may not adventure while in the process of doing this.

### Research

This takes 7 adventuring days and 1,000 gold per level of the spell.  You may not adventure while in the process of doing this.

## [Holy Magic]()

# Referee Section

This is a system made out of house rules.  I wholeheartedly recommend you house rule everything anyway.  I feel like it isn't actually simple and SimpleBX is a bit of a misnomer.

## Death and Dying
Death and Dying are detrimental to getting some characters high enough level for a higher level campaign.  These are some rules to try and blunt that a bit.

### Death Saves
* This RPG includs a death save.  
* You can use this for a death save.  
* You can take a character that's been dropped below 1 HP and if they make their death save, they don't die.
* They're at 0 HP and unconcious instead.

### Bandages
I've added them to the equipment list.  Consider them disposable and easy to ruin.  If the players get don't protect them from dirt and water, they're unusable.
* During combat, allow characters to use one on another character to save them for death.
* Characters get a number of rounds equal to their level to be saved from death.
* This is a second chance to save a character.

### Smelling Salts
I've added them to the equipment list.  Consider them easy to ruin.  They can be reused until the glass vial they're in gets ruined.  
* They can wake up an unconcious character, but they don't heal the character.
* A concious 0HP character is useless.
    * Can't participate in combat.
    * Has a -5 to all saves.
    * Only redeeming quality is that they don't have to be carried.
    * Moves at half speed.

## Author Notes

This document was created, because I'm always dissatisfied with the chunkiness of to-hit modifiers in B/X and it's clones.  I also think that Fighters should also start better at hitting things than other classes.  

Sometimes I wonder if Ability Scores should be used at all.  There's an element of a 1st level Cleric should be a 1st level Cleric and that maybe it would be better to allow the equipment to help differentiate different instances of a Cleric.

I gave everyone Thief skills in reduced count because I felt that most Thief skills (discounting back-stab which is really just a situational fighting thing) are non-combat.  It allows some character customization without the full DPS metagame that's become so central to the game since 2nd edition players options.

I reduced to 6 classes from 7 in B/X, because the Dwarf and Halfling were both Fighters, and I feel like it's more interesting to make the Halfling replace the Thief.

I feel like Gavin Norman has done a banger job restating and laying out the B/X rules, but Dolmenwood has a bunch of "fixes" to the rules that I agree with along with it's integrated setting.

I like the dungeon itself to be the setting.  It should also be perfectly reasonable to do "in town" things without touching the dice.  This document assumes that whatever you're running, you're going to use that or your own mind as the source of whatever sort of metastory you want to have.
