# SimpleBX
Simple BX compatible RPG System

Simple BX is a less of a complete RPG system, but more of a list of references to other documents in order to put together a more modern BX.  Maybe someday I'll get permission from all the sources to compile this into a single PDF (or *gasp* a POD book), but for now it will just be links and a little text as glue.

Damage on a successful weapon attack is no longer depedent on the weapon, but on the class instead.  It's the same as the Hit Die used for hit points.  It still has to be an appropriate weapon.  For instance, a Wizard can't use a 2-Handed sword.

I don't really want to reinvent the wheel.  So the first and biggest references that I'll use are from Gavin Norman's systems and SRDs.  I'll include a bunch of links.

Whatever you call it, DM, GM, Referee, Judge, Labyrinth Lord, or whatever, we'll call them Referees.

# First rules
* The Referee is always right, and if they say that character creation works differently, then in their game character creation works differently.  Same with everything else.
* Something else

# [Character Creation]()
* Use a Tool to roll [Ability Scores](https://www.dolmenwood.necroticgnome.com/rules/doku.php?id=ability_scores#ability_modifiers1).  
* I've created 3 tools for this.  The Referee should pick one of the following and ask players to pick the first scores they get.
    * [Here's a Tool that generates scores where the combined ability score modifier is never less than 1.](https://bmfrosty.github.io/SimpleBX/index.html).
    * [Here's a Tool that generates scores where where constitution is never less than 9.](https://bmfrosty.github.io/SimpleBX/confix.html)
    * [Here's a Tool that generates scores where where constitution is never less than 9, and at least one priority stat is 13 or greater.](https://bmfrosty.github.io/SimpleBX/alwaysgood.html)

# Starting Level

* Characters typically start at level 1
* Sometimes an adventure starts at a higher level or a referee will allow replacement characters to be generated at a higher level.
* When this happens the Referee should probably not start all character types at that level, but instead should give them starting hit points equal to a Fighter at that level.

# Classes
You only get 6.  The Halfling and Thief got rolled together.  Everyone gets some Thief Skills.

## [Cleric](https://www.dolmenwood.necroticgnome.com/rules/doku.php?id=cleric)
Prime Requisite: Wisdom
Hit Die: d6
Armor: Any Armor or Shield that isn't infused with Arcane Magic.  Most magic armor isn't infused with Arcane Magic.  Ask your Referee.

Clerics use Holy Magic.

## [Fighter](https://www.dolmenwood.necroticgnome.com/rules/doku.php?id=fighter)
Prime Requisite: Strength
Hit Die: d8
Armor: Any Armor or Shield

* Fighters can use suitable weapons 2 handed.
    * This prevents the use of a shield, but adds +1 damage to the damage die result.  +2 on a critical hit.

* Prime Requisite: Intelligence
* Hit Die: d4
* Armor: No Armor
* Weapons: Staffs and Daggers
    * A Magic-User can use a staff 2-handed for a +1 to damage
    * This does not leave a free hand for casting

    * This requires a free hand for a Spellbook or Focus
    * Melee weapons or thrown items can't be a Spellbook or Focus
    * Your Referee may countermand this if they think it's fun.
    * At character creation, a Magic User gets up to two level 1 spell.  
    * Roll twice on the on the level 1 table using a d10.
    * If you get the same spell twice, ask your Referee

* Weapons: Any Weapon
At character creation, Elves get a single level 1 spell.  Roll once on the on the level 1 table using a d10.

Elves use Arcanne Magic.

## [Dwarf]()
* A Dwarf is mostly just a fighter that costs more XP.
* Dwarves can use all types of armor, but it must be sized appropriately.
* Dwarves can't use bows or crossbows.  They just refuse.
* Dwarves get a +1 to rolls to detect room traps.
* Dwarves have Infravision.

# [Equipment](https://www.dolmenwood.necroticgnome.com/rules/doku.php?id=adventuring_gear)

| Name | Cost (gp) | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Bandages | 1 | A pack of 10 Bandages |
| Smelling Salts | 10 | A glass vial of smelling salts |

## [Armor](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Weapons_And_Armour)

| Type       | Cost (gp) | AC | Bulk   | Material |
|------------|------|----|--------|----------|
| Leather    | 10   | 12 | Light  | Leather  |
| Chain Mail | 100  | 14 | Medium | Metal    |
| Plate Mail | 1000 | 16 | Heavy  | Metal    |
| Shield     | 10   | +1 | N/A    | Leather  |
| Helmet     | 10   | +0 | N/A    | Leather  |

Base AC is 10.  If you have no armor, your AC will probably be 10.

I include these here.  These are what are available in towns or cities.  You can totally add more types.  You might add Mythril for Elves to allow them heavier Armor, but make them quest for it or make it super expensive.  

## Weapons

We only sort of use weapons here.  They exist, but we abstract out damage.


# [Core Rules](https://www.dolmenwood.necroticgnome.com/rules/doku.php?id=core_rules)

# [Magic]

## [Arcane Magic]()

### [Level 1 spells:](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Magic-User_Spells)

1. Charm Person
2. Floating Disc
3. Hold Portal
4. Light (Darkness)
5. Magic Missile
6. Protection from Evil
7. Read Languages
8. Shield
9. Sleep
10. Ventriloquism

See the Link in the header for a list of all spells.  We drop two in SimpleBX because Magic Users and Elves get them as skills.

### [Arcane Skills]

#### [Detect Magic](https://www.dolmenwood.necroticgnome.com/rules/doku.php?id=magician#magician_skills):

This is a skill instead of a spell in SimpleBX.  See the Magic-User link.

#### Read Magic

Again a skill instead of a spell.  Use your Detect Magic Skill, Modified by your Int modifier.

#### Learning Spells

Learning a new spell is done in one of two ways. Transcription or Research.

### Transcription

You must posess a Scroll or Spellbook of the spell in question.

Roll an Int ability check.  If you succeed, you've transcribed the spell to your spellbook.  If you fail and it's from a scroll, the scroll crumbles and is now gone.  If it's a spellbook, you get to try again when you go up a level.  You can try again at the same level with a different source spellbook or scroll.  This takes an adventuring day and has a cost of 0 gold.  You may not adventure while in the process of doing this.

### Research

This takes 7 adventuring days and 1,000 gold per level of the spell.  You may not adventure while in the process of doing this.

## [Holy Magic]()

# Referee Section

This is a system made out of house rules.  I wholeheartedly recommend you house rule everything anyway.  I feel like it isn't actually simple and SimpleBX is a bit of a misnomer.

## Death and Dying
Death and Dying are detrimental to getting some characters high enough level for a higher level campaign.  These are some rules to try and blunt that a bit.

### Death Saves
* This RPG includs a death save.  
* You can use this for a death save.  
* You can take a character that's been dropped below 1 HP and if they make their death save, they don't die.
* They're at 0 HP and unconcious instead.

### Bandages
I've added them to the equipment list.  Consider them disposable and easy to ruin.  If the players get don't protect them from dirt and water, they're unusable.
* During combat, allow characters to use one on another character to save them for death.
* Characters get a number of rounds equal to their level to be saved from death.
* This is a second chance to save a character.

### Smelling Salts
I've added them to the equipment list.  Consider them easy to ruin.  They can be reused until the glass vial they're in gets ruined.  
* They can wake up an unconcious character, but they don't heal the character.
* A concious 0HP character is useless.
    * Can't participate in combat.
    * Has a -5 to all saves.
    * Only redeeming quality is that they don't have to be carried.
    * Moves at half speed.

## Author Notes

This document was created, because I'm always dissatisfied with the chunkiness of to-hit modifiers in B/X and it's clones.  I also think that Fighters should also start better at hitting things than other classes.  

Sometimes I wonder if Ability Scores should be used at all.  There's an element of a 1st level Cleric should be a 1st level Cleric and that maybe it would be better to allow the equipment to help differentiate different instances of a Cleric.

I gave everyone Thief skills in reduced count because I felt that most Thief skills (discounting back-stab which is really just a situational fighting thing) are non-combat.  It allows some character customization without the full DPS metagame that's become so central to the game since 2nd edition players options.

I reduced to 6 classes from 7 in B/X, because the Dwarf and Halfling were both Fighters, and I feel like it's more interesting to make the Halfling replace the Thief.

I feel like Gavin Norman has done a banger job restating and laying out the B/X rules, but Dolmenwood has a bunch of "fixes" to the rules that I agree with along with it's integrated setting.

I like the dungeon itself to be the setting.  It should also be perfectly reasonable to do "in town" things without touching the dice.  This document assumes that whatever you're running, you're going to use that or your own mind as the source of whatever sort of metastory you want to have.
